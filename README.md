Introducing the ultimate multitasking experience: a tower defense game with a Minesweeper twist, 
brought to you by a group of developers who clearly couldn't decide on just one game idea and 
thought they had too much time on their hands. But hey, who needs a social life when you have tower
defense and Minesweeper combined? Get ready for the ultimate challenge of defending your towers while
also trying not to blow yourself up in the process!

Playing this game may make you confused at first, but you will never get bored! This multiplayer game
is where you can place your defenses and plant mines. Then,  attack your opponent while keeping in mind
that you need to strategize the attack by playing Minesweeper.
